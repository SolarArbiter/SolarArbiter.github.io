# Use Cases


{% include to_top.html %}
## Purpose and Summary {#purpose}
{: .anchor }
This document describes Solar Forecast Arbiter use cases and their associated requirements, and Solar Forecast Arbiter framework functional capabilities. A use case describes a sequence of actions to achieve a goal. To reduce repeating requirements, a use case may adopt, expand, or modify the requirements of another use case.

Use cases are grouped into two categories:

1. [Evaluate forecasts](#evaluatefx). These use cases anticipate a framework user whose primary interest is comparing one or more forecasts to observation data. Forecast quantities can include irradiance, power or net load, and can vary in lead time, interval and horizon. The framework can evaluate deterministic forecasts, event forecasts, and probabilistic forecasts.
2. [Analyze forecasts](#analyzefx). These use cases anticipate a framework user whose primary interest is investigating relationships between forecasts, forecast errors, and other quantities. Examples might include the spread between probabilistic forecasts, the standard deviation of a forecast, or the hit rate of forecasting a specific event (like a large change in power).

Framework functional capabilities are grouped into three additional categories:

{:start="3"}
1. [Perform forecast evaluation in a standard manner](#evaluation)
1. [Administer the framework](#administer)
1. [Archive data and forecasts](#archive)

**For brevity, a *forecast* refers to the *[forecast evaluation time series](/definitions/#forecastevalts)* defined in the [Definitions section](/definitions/).**

Metrics, benchmark forecasts, data formats, data sharing policies, and legal considerations will be detailed in other documents.

The Solar Forecast Arbiter is primarily designed to support the evaluation of solar forecasts that are useful for solar forecast users. It is not a general-purpose weather forecast analysis tool, though it may eventually be extended to incorporate wind power and load forecast analysis.

## Use cases  {#usecases}

### 1. Evaluate forecasts  {#evaluatefx}
{: .anchor}

#### 1.A. Compare a forecast to measurements {#uc1A}
{: .anchor}

**Use case narrative**: A framework user uploads a forecast or selects a benchmark forecast for a single location, uploads corresponding measured data or selects reference data, specifies filters, specifies temporal averaging, and selects metrics. The framework calculates metrics, provides a visual display of forecast performance and an evaluation report for download.

#### 1.F. Conduct forecast trial {#uc1F}
{: .anchor}

**Use case narrative**: The framework administrator, in consultation with trial participants, defines trial period, metrics, locations, forecast quantities, time horizons, time resolutions, etc. of a forecast trial. The trial may be retrospective or live, and may involve a debugging period followed by an evaluation period. Separate trials may be administered for multiple forecast parameters (e.g. hour ahead and day ahead forecast evaluations for the same set of locations).

**Example 1**: Forecast User 1 would like to evaluate the operational performance of many forecast providers. Forecast User 1 and the Framework Administrator announce the opportunity to Forecast Providers A-F. User 1 may announce its intention to contract with one or more Providers at the conclusion of the trial, but this is outside the scope of the Solar Forecast Arbiter.

The User, Administrator, and Providers discuss the many possible forecasts that could be evaluated and determine that two trials will be conducted to support particular business needs. Trial 1 is a 1-hour ahead, 1-hour interval average trial and Trial 2 is day ahead as of 13:00, 1-hour interval trial. The full forecast evaluation time series attributes are defined for each trial. For both trials, the start date is Jan 1, 2020, the end date is March 31, 2020, the evaluation metrics are average hourly MAE and RMSE, and missing forecasts will be assumed to be 0. Trial 1 will include a persistence benchmark, and Trial 2 will include a benchmark based on transparent processing of the NOAA NAM model.

Forecast User 1 creates the Sites, Observations, and Aggregate, uploads 12 months of training data, and shares the data with Forecast Providers A-F. Forecast Providers A-F download the training data and create their models. An anonymous user is automatically generated for each Provider and the Framework Administrator does not keep a record of the user mapping. Separately for each trial, Forecast Providers upload their forecast runs during the debugging period, fix any issues, and continue to regularly upload runs during the evaluation period. Forecasters that fail to submit a forecast run are penalized according to predefined rules. At the conclusion of the trials, reports are automatically generated for all participants.


**Requirements**:

- All requirements as listed for Use Case [1.C](#uc1C).
- Administrator, in consultation with trial participants, defines data sources, forecast run intervals/horizons, trial period, metrics, filters ([4.C](#uc4C)).
- Framework concatenates regularly posted forecast runs into a continuous forecast evaluation time series([4.C](#uc4C)).
- Framework accepts uploads of regularly updated data and allows for download of regularly updated data ([4.C](#uc4C)).
- Framework generates intermediate reports during the trial ([3.D](#uc3D)).

#### 1.G. Compare multiple overlapping forecast runs to measurements (stretch) {#uc1G}
{: .anchor}

**Use case narrative**: A framework user uploads a sequence of overlapping forecast runs issued at a regular interval for a single site or aggregate, uploads corresponding data or selects reference data, specifies filters, specifies temporal averaging, and selects metrics. The framework calculates metrics, provides a visual display of forecast performance and an evaluation report for download.

**Example 1**: Forecast Provider A creates a new 24-hour length forecast run at each hour of the day. Forecast User 1 would like to analyze the accuracy of points in these forecasts as a function of lead time. Forecast Provider A uploads all forecasts to the framework and shares them with Forecast User 1. Forecast User 1 uses the framework to analyze forecast performance across lead times.

**Requirements**:

- All requirements as listed for Use Case [1.A](#uc1A), for each forecast run.
- Each [forecast run](/definitions/#forecastrun) must be identically specified.
- Forecast runs are issued at a regular interval (e.g., every 6 hours).
- User can upload multiple overlapping forecast runs. Each forecast run can have a different issue time, but must have the same forecast interval (duration and label), forecast length and interval value type (e.g. 5-minute interval, 5-minute interval-ending label, 24 hours in length, interval average power forecast).
- User can define forecast evaluation intervals, lead times, and temporal averaging.

#### 1.H. Establish a long-term performance baseline of state-of-the-art operational forecasts (stretch) {#uc1H}
{: .anchor}

**Use case narrative**: The framework administrator, in consultation with providers of operational forecasts, defines metrics, locations, forecast quantities, time horizons, time resolutions, etc. for a long-term, open-ended forecast evaluation. Separate evaluations may be administered for multiple forecast parameters (e.g. hour ahead and day ahead forecast evaluations for the same set of locations). Forecast performance is used to establish a long-term performance baseline of state-of-the-art operational forecasts.

**Example 1**: Forecast Providers A-F anonymously submit operational forecasts to the framework for all SURFRAD sites and handful of PV power plants across the country. Forecasts include 24-hour lead time, hourly interval and 1-hour lead time, 5-minute interval. Analysis of forecasts during the trial provide a baseline of operational forecast performance. Later, an organization funds a research effort to improve forecasts. In a retrospective or live trial scenario, the research effort submits its new forecasts to the framework for comparison against the operational forecast baseline.

**Requirements**:

- All requirements as listed for Use Case [1.F](#uc1F).
- Framework tracks and reports forecast metrics over time.
- Framework allows summary statistics from long-term trials to be used as a point of reference in reports generated for other use cases.
