# Use Cases

*We are currently asking stakeholders to provide feedback on the Solar Forecast Arbiter use cases. Please take just a couple of minutes to provide simple feedback using this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/F1qq08JppsKBMUtj2). Stakeholders may also markup this [word document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18cL-sZnStsZzOzbeSV0hWmh06G3ESEpN) and email it to a team member or [info@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:info@solarforecastarbiter.org).*

## Purpose and Summary {#purpose}
{: .anchor }
This document describes Solar Forecast Arbiter use cases and their associated requirements, and Solar Forecast Arbiter framework functional capabilities.

The Solar Forecast Arbiter is primarily designed to support the evaluation of solar forecasts that are useful for solar forecast users. It is not a general-purpose weather forecast analysis tool, though it may eventually be extended to incorporate wind power and load forecast analysis.

Use cases are grouped into two categories:

1. [Evaluate forecasts](#evaluatefx). These use cases anticipate a framework user whose primary interest is comparing one or more forecasts to data. Forecast quantities can include irradiance, power or net load, and can vary in lead time, interval and horizon. The framework can evaluate deterministic forecasts, event forecasts, and probabilistic forecasts.
2. [Analyze forecasts](#analyzefx). These use cases anticipate a framework user whose primary interest is investigating correlations between forecasts, forecast errors, and other quantities.

Framework functional capabilities are grouped into three categories:

1. [Perform forecast evaluation in a standard manner](#evaluation)
2. [Administer the framework](#administer)
3. [Archive data and forecasts](#archive)

Metrics, benchmark forecasts, data formats, data sharing policies, and legal considerations will be detailed in other documents.

## Definitions  {#definitions}
{: .anchor}

The precise definition of a *forecast* is often a source of confusion in the forecasting industry. Consider these statements that use the term *forecast*:

<ol type="A">
  <li>"The forecast for the next 48 hours is 5 MW, 10 MW, 7 MW..."</li>
  <li>"The hour ahead forecast this morning was 5 MW, 10 MW, 7 MW..."</li>
</ol>

In Statement A, the user refers to a series of expected values issued at a **single** point in time. In Statement B, the user refers to a series of expected values with the **same** lead time that are issued at **different** points in time.

An evaluation challenge arises if Statement A is extended to include a new 48 hour duration forecast every hour. In this scenario, many forecasts exist at each evaluation time. More information is needed to focus the analysis to a particular application.

Statement B suggests an alternative strategy: the forecast user or the forecast provider parses forecast data into a timeseries for evaluation according to her **application**. For example, from many 48 hour length forecasts, a timeseries of forecast values with lead times of 1 hour ahead could be compiled to evaluate forecasts that support participation in a particular market. Or, a timeseries of forecast values for each hour of the day ahead could be compiled from forecasts issued at the same time each day to evaluate forecasts input to a production cost model. In each case, the forecast under evaluation is a continuous, non-overlapping timeseries that can be compared to observations.

The Solar Forecast Arbiter is designed to analyze these user-supplied, continuous, non-overlapping timeseries. We refer to this as a *forecast evaluation timeseries*.

The Solar Forecast Arbiter provides a taxonomy to allow forecast users and forecast providers to clearly and completely describe each forecast evaluation timeseries. For most use cases, the user is required to consider the forecast application, parse the forecast data into a continuous, non-overlapping timeseries for evaluation, and provide the parsed data to the Solar Forecast Arbiter for analysis â€“ not the individual forecast runs that went into the parsed forecast.

The sections below define and illustrate the key terms and concepts.


### Forecast evaluation timeseries, forecast runs, and forecast datapoints {#forecastdef}
{: .anchor}

**Forecast datapoint**. A *forecast datapoint* is a single (*Time*, *Value*) data pair. Time can label a moment in time or an interval of time, as defined by the interval type label. For example, a Time of 17:00 can label the hour-long interval beginning from 17:00 to 18:00 (period beginning label), 16:00 to 17:00 (period ending label) or instantaneously at 17:00 (instantaneous label). Value has a *quantity* (e.g., mean, 95th percentile) and *type* (e.g. power, GHI). The type defines the unit.

**Forecast run**. A _forecast run_ is a sequence of one or more *forecast datapoints* issued at the same time.  An example forecast run for the average hourly power at Power Plant X, issued at 16:00 for the next three hours, could be {(17:00, 5 MW), (18:00, 10 MW), (19:00, 7 MW)}. A forecast run is described by the following attributes (with the values relevant to this example in parentheses):

1.	Issue time (16:00)
2.	Lead time to start (1 hour)
3.	Interval duration (1 hour)
4.	Number of intervals per submission (3)
5.	Forecast issue frequency (3 hr)
6.	Interval label (start)
7.	Value type (mean)
8.	Variable (power)
9.	Site (Power Plant X)

**Forecast evaluation timeseries**. A _forecast evaluation timeseries_ is a complete series of (*forecast datapoints*) spanning from a _start time_ to an _end time_. For example, a single *forecast run* is a *forecast evaluation timeseries*. Typically, a *forecast evaluation timeseries* is the concatenation of a series of identically specified forecast runs with sequential issue times, as shown in the figure below. For example, three forecast runs (green) could be:

- {(13:00, 10MW)} issued at 12:00, and
- {(14:00, 7MW)} issued at 13:00, and
- {(15:00, 5MW)} issued at 14:00.

From these three runs, the user could upload an hour ahead, hour interval forecast of:

- {(13:00, 10MW), (14:00, 7MW), (15:00, 5MW)}

 ![timeline_concat_1h](/images/timeline_concat_1h.svg){: .usecase-figure}

The framework also supports *forecast evaluation timeseries* that are the concatenation of *forecast runs* with more than one interval, so long as the intervals do not overlap. The example below shows how three different hour-ahead, 15-minute interval, 1-hour duration *forecast runs* may be parsed and concatenated into a single forecast evaluation timeseries.

 ![timeline_concat](/images/timeline_concat.svg){: .usecase-figure}

This concept also applies to the evaluation of day-ahead forecasts issued at a particular time of day. For example, hour average forecasts for next day as of 16:00 previous day can be represented by a concatenation of forecasts with start time of midnight, 8-hour lead time to start, 1-hour interval, 24 intervals per submission, and 1 day frequency.

For most use cases ([1.A](#uc1A)-[1.E](#uc1E)), the framework expects forecast providers to upload a *forecast evaluation timeseries*. For the Forecast Trial use case ([1.F](#uc1F)), the Solar Forecast Arbiter expects forecast providers to regularly upload a _forecast runs_ that the Solar Forecast Arbiter can concatenate into a *forecast evaluation timeseries*.

A stretch goal is to support the use case of uploading and analyzing multiple forecast runs with the same valid times ([1.G](#uc1G)). For example, the user could upload each of the forecast runs specified above, and then use the framework to merge the forecast runs into a 0, 1, or 2 hour ahead forecast for evaluation. The figure below shows three forecasts runs (green) merged into two different evaluation forecasts (blue, red).

 ![timeline_merge](/images/timeline_merged.svg){: .usecase-figure}


### Forecast evaluation timeseries attributes {#forecastattrs}
{: .anchor}

The Solar Forecast Arbiter uses the set of attributes defined below to describe the characteristics of a forecast evaluation timeseries. This structure allows any type of forecast typically utilized in the solar energy field to be evaluated.

A *forecast evaluation timeseries* is a serially complete time series of values with the following attributes:

1.	Issue time - The time of day that a forecast is issued, e.g. 13:00. Multiple issue times are uniquely determined by any one issue time and forecast issue frequency.
2.	Lead time to start - The difference between each issue time and the start of the first forecast interval, e.g. 1 hour.
3.	Interval duration - The length of time that each data point represents, e.g. 5 minutes, 1 hour.
4.	Intervals per submission - The number of intervals in each forecast submission, e.g. 12.
5.	Forecast issue frequency - The frequency at which new forecasts are issued, e.g. 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day.
6.	Interval label - Indicates if a time labels the start or the end of an interval, or indicates an instantaneous value.
7.	Value type - The type of the data in the forecast, e.g. mean, max, 95th percentile.
8.	Variable - The variable in the forecast, e.g. power, GHI, DNI. Each variable is associated with a standard unit.
9.	Site - The predefined site that the forecast is for, e.g. Power Plant X or Aggregate Y.

A forecast must be associated with a pre-defined site. The site, not the forecast, defines geographic location and the variable determines the units.


### Framework user and framework administrator {#users}
{: .anchor}

A _framework user_ is an individual or organization that uses the capabilities of Solar Forecast Arbiter to evaluate and analyze forecasts. A framework user can be a _forecast provider_ (one who creates a forecast), a _forecast user_ (one using a forecast for a defined purpose), researchers, and others.

The _framework administrator_ operates Solar Forecast Arbiter, ensures data security and anonymity, establishes standards for forecast evaluation, and provides benchmark forecasts.



## Use cases  {#usecases}
