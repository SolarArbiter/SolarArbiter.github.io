Getting Started
===============
{: .anchor}

Registering an account on the Solar Forecast Arbiter will grant you access to
the Arbiter's Reference data set. To utilize other Arbiter features such as
sharing and uploading data, running reports, and participating in trials,
you'll first need to establish an Organization or join an existing one. 

### Signing up
{: .anchor}

New framework users will need to sign up through the [Solar Forecast Arbiter
dashboard](https://dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org). The signup form can be
found by following the 'Log in' link on the front page of the dashboard. You
will be prompted with an Auth0 login window. Click the sign up tab and enter
your information. Users will receive an email from Solar Forecast Arbiter to
verify their account. Account verification is required before you will be able
to access data in the Solar Forecast Arbiter. 

Auth0 is a secure authentication service that has numereous security
credentials and undergoes routine audits.

### Organizations
{:.anchor}

Organizations are groups of users whose permissions and data are managed by
the same group of administrators. An organization retains ownership of all data
submitted by its members. Only organization administrators will be authorized
to grant users permissions to view or alter data owned by their organization.

#### Creating an Organization
{: .anchor}

When ready to create an organization, users should contact the framework
administrators at [admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org)
to start the process. The framework administrators will provide the
non-negotiable [Data Use Agreement](/assets/45864%20Approved_Final%20version%201.1.pdf),
the user will review the Data Use Agreement and return the Data Use Agreement
signed by an authorized representative of their organization. A [point of contact](#organization-point-of-contact) will be established to verify future updates to the
organization. An organization administrator will be appointed by the point of
contact to manage data access.

#### Joining an Organization
Users can join an existing organization by emailing the framework
administrators at [admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org).
Framework administrators will verify with the organization's point of contact
that the user is authorized to join the organization. To expedite this process,
an organization's point of contact may initiate a request to add the user to
their organization.

### User Classifications
{: .anchor}

Users of the Solar Forecast Arbiter will fall into one of the following
classifications.

#### Organization Point of Contact
{:.anchor}

An organization's point of contact is a representative of the organization who
is authorized to approve or request changes to the organization. There may be
more than one point of contact for an organization. A point of contact will be
capable of contacting the framework administrators to complete the following
actions:

- Adding and removing users from the organization.

- Promoting users to [organization administrators](#organization-administrators).

- Participating in trials.

#### Organization Administrators
{: .anchor}

Organization Administrators are users with special permissions to act on users,
roles and permissions in their organization. Organization administrators are
also granted full access to their organization's data. An organization's point
of contact may request that users in their organization be promoted to an
organization administrator by emailing a request to
[admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org).

Administrators will be allowed to [grant](/documentation/dashboard/administration#granting-roles-to-a-user)
and [revoke](/documentation/dashboard/administration#revoking-roles-from-a-user)
roles from users in their organization and add or remove permissions from
roles. Roles may be granted to members of other organizations provided their
organization has aggreed to the Data Use Aggreement.

All administrative permissions other than read access, e.g. those allowing
create, update, grant, revoke or delete on users, roles or permissions, are
restricted to sharing with users in the same organization. For example,
attempts to grant a role with permission to *update users* to a member of
another organization or to add the *update users* permission to a role that
has been granted outside the organization will not be allowed.
        

#### Standard user
{: .anchor}

Solar Forecast Arbiter users are added to the *Unaffiliated* organization by
default. Unaffiliated users will have access to the reference data set but
may not gain further access until they have joined an organization that has
accepted the data use agreement.

An organization's [point of contact](#organization-point-of-contact) may submit
a request to [admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org)
to add a user to their organization. Once the user has been added to the
organization, an [organization administrator](#organization-administrators) may
grant the user access to the organization's data.
