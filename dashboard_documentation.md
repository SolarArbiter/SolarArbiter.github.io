Dashboard Documentation
=======================
{: .anchor}

The Solar Forecast Arbiter Dashboard is a web interface for managing solar
observation and forecast data and for evaluating solar forecast accuracy.
This documentation provides step-by-step examples of how to perform
common activities on the Solar Forecast Arbiter dashboard. The Content menu
can be used to navigate between each activity. Each section includes
instructions and screenshots.

Be sure to read the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for instructions
on how to access the current version of the dashboard.
Please see the [data model documentation](/datamodel/) for more details on
how the Solar Forecast Arbiter organizes metadata (Sites, Observations, and Forecasts)
and time series data.
Tutorial materials are available in our [2019 Denver Workshop repository](https://github.com/SolarArbiter/2019-Denver-Workshop).


Getting Started
---------------
{: .anchor}

The alpha release of the Solar Forecast Arbiter dashboard does not yet support automatic
signup. In the meantime, you may use any of the credentials below to log in and
explore the dashboard. You will be prompted to log in on the front page of the
dashboard at [dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org](https://dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org)

{: .table}
|Email                                 | Password          |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------|
|testing@solarforecastarbiter.org      |Thepassword123!    |
|utilityx@solarforecastarbiter.org     |Utilitypassword!   |
|forecastera@solarforecastarbiter.org  |Forecasterpassword!|

In a later release, users will be able to signup and join existing organizations with
approval of that organization's administrators.
