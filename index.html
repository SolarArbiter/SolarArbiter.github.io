<h2>Solar Forecast Arbiter</h2>

<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar irradiance, solar power, and net-load forecasts that are impartial, repeatable and auditable. The Solar Forecast Arbiter supports the DOE Solar Forecasting 2 program and the broader solar forecast community. Please sign up for the mailing list below to receive quarterly project updates.</p>

<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is in an early stage of development, and we need members of the solar forecast community to provide guidance on project development. If you would like to join the project's Stakeholder Committee, please fill out the form below and check <em>Stakeholder Committee</em>. Please also indicate if you are a member of a Solar Forecasting 2 project team.</p>

<p>This project is funded under the DOE SETO <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-forecasting-2">Solar Forecasting 2</a> program. See the SETO project summary <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/project-profile-university-arizona-solar-forecasting-2">here</a>.</p>
