<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar irradiance, solar power, and net-load forecasts that are impartial, repeatable and auditable. The Solar Forecast Arbiter supports the <a href="http://www.energy.gov/solar-office">U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office</a> Solar Forecasting 2 program and the broader solar forecast community. Please <a href="/emaillist">sign up for the mailing list</a> to receive quarterly project updates.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/funding">funding page</a> for more information on the project's DOE SETO funding.</p>
<p>We continue to seek members of the solar forecast community to provide guidance on project development. Please see our <a href="/stakeholdercommittee">Stakeholder Committee</a> page for more information on how you can join the committee and help guide the project development.</p>

<p>This project page contains reference materials describing project use cases, metrics, reference data, and more under the Key Topics menu. Visit the <a href="https://dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org/">Solar Forecast Arbiter Dashboard</a> to browse data and evaluate forecasts. Documentation is available under the Documentation menu.</p>
