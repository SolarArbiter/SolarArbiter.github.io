<h2>Solar Forecast Arbiter</h2>

<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar irradiance, solar power, and net-load forecasts that are impartial, repeatable and auditable. The Solar Forecast Arbiter supports the DOE Solar Forecasting 2 program and the broader solar forecast community.</p>

<p>It is in an early stage of development, and we need members of the solar forecast community to provide guideance on project development. If you are interested in participating in the project's Stakeholder Committee, please email Will Holmgren at <a href="mailto:holmgren@email.arizona.edu">holmgren@email.arizona.edu</a>.</p>
<p>This project is funded under the DOE SETO <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-forecasting-2">Solar Forecasting</a> 2 program. See the SETO summary <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/project-profile-university-arizona-solar-forecasting-2">here</a>.</p>
