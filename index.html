<h1>Solar Forecast Arbiter</h1>

<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar irradiance, solar power, and net-load forecasts that are impartial, repeatable and auditable. The Solar Forecast Arbiter supports the DOE Solar Forecasting 2 program and the broader solar forecast community. Please <a href="/emaillist">sign up for the mailing list</a> to receive quarterly project updates.</p>

<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is in an early stage of development, and we need members of the solar forecast community to provide guidance on project development. Please see our <a href="/stakeholdercommittee">Stakeholder Committee</a> page for more information on how you can join the committee and help guide the project development.</p>

<p><b>We are currently asking stakeholders to provide feedback on the first Key Topic: the Solar Forecast Arbiter <a href="/usecases">Use Cases</a>. Please see <a href="/stakeholdercommittee">Stakeholder Committee</a> for more information. The deadline for feedback is January 4, 2019.</b></p>

<p>Early draft versions of addititional documents are available under the Key Topics menu. These guidance documents will be refined and reviewed by stakeholders through June 2019.</p>

<p>This project is funded under the DOE SETO <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-forecasting-2">Solar Forecasting 2</a> program. See the SETO project summary <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/project-profile-university-arizona-solar-forecasting-2">here</a>.</p>
