<h1>Solar Forecast Arbiter</h1>

<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar irradiance, solar power, and net-load forecasts that are impartial, repeatable and auditable. The Solar Forecast Arbiter supports the <a href="http://www.energy.gov/solar-office">U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office</a> Solar Forecasting 2 program and the broader solar forecast community. Please <a href="/emaillist">sign up for the mailing list</a> to receive quarterly project updates.</p>
<p>See the <a href="/funding">funding page</a> for more information on the project's DOE SETO funding.</p>
<p>The Solar Forecast Arbiter is in an early stage of development, and we need members of the solar forecast community to provide guidance on project development. Please see our <a href="/stakeholdercommittee">Stakeholder Committee</a> page for more information on how you can join the committee and help guide the project development.</p>

<p>Early draft versions of addititional documents are available under the Key Topics menu. These guidance documents will be refined and reviewed by stakeholders through June 2019.</p>
