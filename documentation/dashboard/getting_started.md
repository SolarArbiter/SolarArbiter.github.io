Getting Started
===============
{: .anchor}

To get started with the Solar Forecast Arbiter you'll first need to
[sign up](#signing-up) for an account. This automatic process immediately
grants you access to the Arbiter's reference data and reference forecasts.

Users who want to access all of the Arbiter's features will need to
[create a new Organization](#creating-an-organization) or
[join an existing Organization](#joining-an-organization). This will give you
access to the full set of Arbiter features, including:

- Uploading data to the Arbiter for quality checking and validation.
- Sharing data between organizations.
- Running reports to analyze forecast data.
- Participating in competitive forecast trials.

### Signing up

### Organizations
{:.anchor}

Organizations are groups of users whose permissions and data are managed by
the same group of administrators. An organization retains ownership of all data
submitted by its members. Only organization administrators will be authorized
to grant users permissions to view or alter data owned by their organization.

#### Creating an Organization
{: .anchor}

To create an new organization, send a signed
[Data Use Agreement](/assets/45864%20Approved_Final%20version%201.1.pdf)
to the Solar Forecast Arbiter Administrators at
[admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org). The
administrators will create a new organization for you and assign your user
account to administer it.


#### Joining an Organization
{: .anchor}

Users can join an existing organization by emailing the framework
administrators at [admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org).
Framework administrators will verify with the organization's point of contact
that the user is authorized to join the organization. To expedite this process,
an organization's point of contact may initiate a request to add the user to
their organization.
