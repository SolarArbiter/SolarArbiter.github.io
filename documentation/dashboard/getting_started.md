Getting Started
===============
{: .anchor}

Registering an account on the Solar Forecast Arbiter is a two step process:

1. [Sign up](#signing-up) for an account. This automatic process immediately
grants you access to the Arbiter's reference data and reference forecasts.

2. [Create a new Organization](#creating-an-organization) or [join an existing
Organization](#joining-an-organization). This manual process grants you access
to the rest of the Arbiter's features including uploading data, sharing data,
running reports, and participating in trials.

The sections below describe these steps in more detail.

### Signing up

New framework users sign up through the <a href="https://dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org">Solar Forecast Arbiter dashboard</a>.
The signup form is found by following the 'Log in' link on the front page of
 the dashboard. You will be prompted with an Auth0 login window
(<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/getting-started/overview">Auth0</a> is a secure
authentication service). Click the sign up tab and enter your information.
Users will receive an email from Solar Forecast Arbiter to verify their
account. Account verification is required before you will be able to access

### Organizations
{:.anchor}

Organizations are groups of users whose permissions and data are managed by
the same group of administrators. An organization retains ownership of all data
submitted by its members. Only organization administrators will be authorized
to grant users permissions to view or alter data owned by their organization.

#### Creating an Organization
{: .anchor}

To create an new organization, send a signed
[Data Use Agreement](/assets/45864%20Approved_Final%20version%201.1.pdf)
to the Solar Forecast Arbiter Administrators at
[admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org). The
administrators will create a new organization for you and assign your user
account to administer it.


#### Joining an Organization
{: .anchor}

Users can join an existing organization by emailing the framework
administrators at [admin@solarforecastarbiter.org](mailto:admin@solarforecastarbiter.org).
Framework administrators will verify with the organization's point of contact
that the user is authorized to join the organization. To expedite this process,
an organization's point of contact may initiate a request to add the user to
their organization.
