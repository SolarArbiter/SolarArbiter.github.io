Solar Forecast Arbiter dashboard.

Documentation is separated into the following sections:

  the dashboard, sign up for new accounts, create new organizations, and add
  users to organizations.
- [Working with Data](/documentation/dashboard/working-with-data): how to
  create, upload, and download data.
- [Administration and Data Sharing](/documentation/dashboard/administration):
  how to share and restrict data access.

Additional training materials are available in our
