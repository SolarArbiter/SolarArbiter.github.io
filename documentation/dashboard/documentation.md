The [Solar Forecast Arbiter Dashboard](https://dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org)
is a web site for evaluating solar forecast accuracy. This documentation
provides step-by-step instructions of how to perform common activities on the
Solar Forecast Arbiter dashboard.

Documentation is separated into the following sections:

- [Getting Started](/documentation/dashboard/getting-started): how to access
  the dashboard, sign up for new accounts, create new organizations, and add
  users to organizations.
- [Working with Data](/documentation/dashboard/working-with-data): how to
  create, upload, and download data.
- [Administration and Data Sharing](/documentation/dashboard/administration):
  how to manage users and share or restrict data access.

Additional training materials are available in our
[workshop repository](https://github.com/SolarArbiter/workshop).

A summary of the version history of the Dashboard is available in the [changelog](/changelog).
