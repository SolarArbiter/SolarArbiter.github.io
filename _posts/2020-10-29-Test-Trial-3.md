Test Trial 3 will test day ahead and hour ahead forecasts for AC power, mean SURFRAD GHI, and probabilistic forecasts of GHI. This trial will run on Solar Forecast Arbiter version 1.0rc4.

We ask that users not upload real forecasts for these initial beta-tests of the trial system. Rather, users should upload non-proprietary, random, constant, or other types of forecast that can be made public. This will allow all of parties to the testing to trace and debug errors without security concerns. To the extent that it’s feasible to program within your systems, we recommend running your systems as if you were making a real forecast but then replacing the final data with fake data before posting it to the Arbiter’s API.

Please see the [Trials Documentation](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/2020/02/12/Trials-Testing.html) for a complete description of the Solar Forecast Arbiter's trials feature. The documentation also contains an example Python script to help you get started programming against the API, but we encourage you to write your own scripts that mimic how you would handle real forecast data from your systems.

The following forecast start, end, and timing parameters are the same for all forecasts:

* Start time: 2020-11-10 19:00Z
* End time: 2020-11-12 19:00Z
* Forecast parameters:
  * 60 minutes ahead of the hour, 60 minute intervals:
    * Issue time: 00:00
    * Lead time to start: 60 minutes
    * Interval length: 60 minutes
    * Interval value type: mean
    * Run length: 60 minutes
    * Interval label: ending
  * Day ahead:
    * Issue time: 19Z
    * Lead time to start: 24 hours
    * Interval length: 1 hour
    * Interval value type: mean
    * Interval label: ending
    * Run length: 24 hours

The following 3 sets of metadata describe the observations, metrics, categories, quality flags, missing forecast policy, and reference forecasts:

  * MAE, MBE, RMSE, Skill
* Categories:
  * Total, daily, hour of day
* Quality filters to exclude:
