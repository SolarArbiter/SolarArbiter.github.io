A quick summary of activities on the Solar Forecast Arbiter project so far:

* **Stakeholder Engagement Workshop**. The team held the first Stakeholder Engagement Workshop in June 2018 immediately following the ESIG Forecasting Workshop in St. Paul. More than 40 stakeholders participated in lively discussions and provided crucial guidance to the team.
* **Stakeholder Committee**. Approximately 25 stakeholders joined the [Stakeholder Committee](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/stakeholdercommittee/) to provide feedback on project development. We're always looking for more!
* **Use Cases**. The team developed a set of use cases designed to make the evaluation of solar forecasts more concrete. Great stakeholder feedback significantly improved the use cases. Review the use cases [here](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/usecases/).
* **AMS activities**. The team presented an overview talk of the project and a poster focusing on benchmark forecast capabilities. Review the talk and poster on the [publications page](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/publications/).

Over the next few months we'll ask the Stakeholder Committee for feedback on data exchange (web and API), data policies (sharing, NDA, security), metrics (deterministic, probabilistic, cost), and benchmark forecasts (irradiance, power, net load). Sign up for the [email list](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/emaillist/) if you want the opportunity to provide feedback on those topics.
