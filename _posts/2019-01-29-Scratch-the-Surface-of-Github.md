If you're reading this, you should take 5 minutes to complete a handful of intro GitHub tasks. It's free and it's easy.

First, sign up for GitHub at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/). If asked, choose the free plan.

Why? Creating a GitHub account will give you **much** more visibility in project development (which you can later ignore as you like). Almost all of the programmers that you want to hire over the next 5-10 years are going to think highly of the fact that you have a GitHub account. And basic familiarity with GitHub is a nice skill to have in your pocket these days!

One great thing about GitHub is that you can "watch" a project's development. This means that you receive emails or web notifications when a new issue, pull request, or change to the code occurs on a project. Learn more about notifications [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications/). I recommend that you “watch” at least the Solar Forecast Arbiter's [website repository](https://github.com/SolarArbiter/SolarArbiter.github.io). Click that link and then click “Watch” in the upper right corner. By default, you’ll get an email for all notifications. Consider creating an email filter or modifying your [notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications) to "web only".

The "core" code of the Solar Forecast Arbiter will live in [solarforecastarbiter-core](https://github.com/SolarArbiter/solarforecastarbiter-core), including the metrics computations, data qualification toolkit, data collection scripts, and more. You can review or watch all of the project's repositories [here](https://github.com/solararbiter).

Creating a GitHub account will allow you to raise new "issues" for the team to resolve. For example, you may discover a typo or broken link on the project web page. Or maybe you find a problem in the way we handle missing data in a calculation. Post the problem to the GitHub repository instead of emailing and it won't get lost in our inboxes! Click the "issues" tab of the relevant repository to make a new issue. See [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) for more info on creating an issue. Even better, propose a solution in a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) -- but that's a topic for another post.

You might also want to checkout the [pvlib python](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python) repository to see a more mature project with more contributors. Some issues relevant to Solar Forecasting 2 include [#589](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues/589) and [#590](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues/590). The [solarfx2 tag](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Asolarfx2+) shows a list of all pvlib python activities that are directly related to Solar Forecasting 2.
