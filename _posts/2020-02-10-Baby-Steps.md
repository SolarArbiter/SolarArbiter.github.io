Are you curious about the Solar Forecast Arbiter but you don’t want to
commit or you’re not sure how to get started? This is for you!

First, we totally understand your hesitation. Full use of the Solar
Forecast Arbiter requires a lot of trust in the technical aspects of the
platform and in the platform administrators. We expect to build that
trust over time. The Solar Forecast Arbiter also has a bit of a learning
curve, and we expect users to build expertise over time.

So, we’d like to propose a set of baby steps that stakeholders can take
to build trust and expertise.

**Step 0**: Make a free, no-obligation, no-lawyers-required user account at
[dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org](https://dashboard.solarforecastarbiter.org). Then:
  * Explore the reference data, reference forecasts, and the daily updated
reports for select reference data and forecasts.
  * Download some reference data, forecasts, or report metrics.

*Do this today!*

If you like what you see, consider approaching the Arbiter in the following steps:

1. Have an authorized representative at your organization sign the no-obligation,
   [Data Use Agreement](https://solarforecastarbiter.org/assets/45864%20Approved_Final%20version%201.1.pdf):
      * You cannot utilize the full functionality of the platform until this
        step has been completed
      * Signing the DUA is free and does NOT obligate you to share any data.
        It is not a data sharing agreement, rather it is an agreement about
        how the framework, and data on it, may be used.
      * You are **never** obligated to upload any data to the platform.
        When you do upload data, the default is that it is private.
        Only data owners can change sharing privileges.  As a data owner
        you are in control of who sees your data and you can
        remove it at any time.
2. [Make some dummy metadata](documentation/dashboard/working-with-data/#create-new-site),
   [upload some dummy data](documentation/dashboard/working-with-data/#upload-data),
   [make an analysis report](documentation/dashboard/working-with-data/#create-new-report)
   for reference sites and/or dummy data.
3. [Share private dummy data](documentation/dashboard/administration/#data-sharing)
   with one or two other users within and outside
   your organization to get an understanding of how data sharing and privacy
   works.
4. Add real observational or forecast metadata, and upload real data for one
   or two sites.
5. Use the Arbiter to produce an analysis report for a small, real world
   forecast problem.

Once you feel comfortable with the platform, consider a few more options:

1. Participate in an operational forecast trial.
2. Build the Arbiter into a regular workflow.
3. Review the Arbiter’s REST API at
   [api.solarforecastarbiter.org](https://api.solarforecastarbiter.org)
4. In collaboration with the Arbiter’s administrators, provide one-off data
   from a small test system to the public reference data set. Public reference
   forecasts will be created for these sites for the period of data that was provided.
5. With the Arbiter’s administrators, provide real-time data to the public
   reference data set. Public, real-time reference forecasts will be created
   for these sites.
